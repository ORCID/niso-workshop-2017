**Who we are:**

- Non-profit 
- Open source project ([ORCID Github repository](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source))
- Committed international community

**Our goal:**

All who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are **uniquely identified** and **connected to their contributions** across disciplines, borders, and time.

**What we provide:**

- **Persistent digital identifier** for researchers (ORCID iD):<br>[https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5727-2427](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5727-2427)
- **Registry** of those identifiers + their connections to affiliations and research activities
- **APIs** for creating/retrieving metadata about connections between people, affiliations and research activities

**Why?**

- Help people find information (like all of a researcher's publications)
- Simplify reporting and analysis (by providing a central source for info about researcher's affilations and activiteis)
- Reduce time spent filling out forms (by providing a source for autopopulating form fields)


ORCID doesn't do this on its own - integrations with other systems (like manuscript submission/production, funding application, repository, research information, and directory systems) are essential.

##About the ORCID APIs
ORCID's web interface gives researchers a way to interact with their record, but the real power of ORCID lies in the underlying data, which can be accessed by people and systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

* **Public API:** Free to anyone with an ORCID iD
* **Basic Member API:** Available to ORCID member organizations who subscribe at the Basic level (Sandbox Member API freely available for testing)
* **Premium Member API:** Available to ORCID member organizations who subscribed at the Premium level (Sandbox Premium Member API freely available for testing)

All of the ORCID APIs are  based on the same set of technologies:

* **REST:** ORCID APIs are &ldquo;RESTful&rdquo;, which  means that they use HTTP to transfer information.
* **OAuth:** ORCID  APIs use the [OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to grant client  applications access to users&rsquo; ORCID records.
* **XML/JSON:** ORCID APIs support data exchange in either XML or JSON format.
